Launch Byobu
Open a random number of splits, random sizes
In each split, run a noisy text app

Security Note:
 - Some widgets display real system information (processes, logs,
   network stats, file system details) that could be sensitive
 - For demos or presentations, consider running in a container:
     docker run -it --rm dustinkirkland/hollywood

Rules:
 - Must work as a non-root user
 - Must display information indefinitely (a la "watch", or cmatrix)
   + Can use a while/true + a timeout
 - Must not OOM a system
 - Must not over load a system
 - Must not be too egregious with I/O
 - Must not require outbound internet access
